#+title: advent of code 2025

I've ended up only keeping the solutions for part 2 of some of the problems this year (first year doing it)

Paste the input for day ~<n>~ into a new file ~d<n>.input~, and run with ~nim r d<n>.nim~

Requires ~nim >= 2.2.6~ for some useful things added to ~std/sequtils~

Day-specific notes:
* Day 10
No more z3! But instead we have brute force

Takes about 22 seconds on my machine with ~-d:release~, unsure if it'll work with other inputs without tweaking
